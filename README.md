# ðŸ§  BrainCells

**BrainCells** is where Iâ€™m building different neural networks from scratch â€” no autograd, no high-level libraries. Just tensors, math, and a lot of debugging.

## ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s in here so far

### â–¸ Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Fully connected feedforward network  
- Manual forward pass and backpropagation  
- Mini-batch training loop  
- ReLU activation, MSE loss  
- Built using only PyTorch tensors

## ðŸ’­ Why Iâ€™m doing this
I wanted to really understand how neural networks work â€” not just use them, but *build* them.  
This repo is my way of exploring that, one model at a time.

## ðŸ“– Blog post

Iâ€™ve written a blog post that explains the math behind neural networks in detail â€” it's what this repo is based on.
